# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: 5th September, 2022 (Web Development)

**Today's Topic**: Intermediate CSS.

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Sizing, float and clear. Done with My Personal Website using HTML5 & CSS3.

**Thoughts:** Sizing and Styling the Website isn't easy it took lots of concentration. css code should be in hierarchy so it's easy to find that class easily.
