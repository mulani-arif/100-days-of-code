# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 1st September, 2022 (Web Development)
##### (Started Today)

**Today's Progress**: Watched some lectures on Udemy today and later, made notes from devdocs.io and w3schools.

**Thoughts:** It was a very lousy start to be honest but, will certainly improve and try to spend more time learning.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
