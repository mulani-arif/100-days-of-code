# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2nd September, 2022 (Web Development)

**Today's Topic**: HTML Tables and Forms.

**Today's Progress**: Watched some lectures on Udemy and later, read notes from MDN and published 1st website (only HTML) with Github pages.

**Thoughts:** HTML tables are quite complex in case of nesting. It was a nice experience in 2 days of coding and publishing 1st only HTML website.
