### Day 2: 3rd September, 2022 (Web Development)

**Today's Topic**: Introduction to CSS.

**Today's Progress**: Watched CSS lectures on Udemy and later, made short notes of CSS and Update the Website with effect of CSS.

**Thoughts:** Anatomy of CSS is important and even Preferences too. Difference between a class and an ID is that not hard.
